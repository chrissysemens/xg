### xG Footy charts
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

WIP (First commit) - Playing with football predictions using historic result data and poisson distribution, presenting data using recharts.

Code is still rough, aiming to move a lot of the data processing to Google cloud functions. Fun nontheless.

Progress so far viewable at https://www.footycharts.co.uk (rough)
